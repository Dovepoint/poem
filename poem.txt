Tryanny in the streets:

Wanton anger cries aloft as woman turned her cheek
The fury flouted all regard to meet her 
Upon seeing him in ugly fullness she felt sweetly weak.
When he comest see not the form he takes but what he becomes
A delicate touch on a dainty wrist as he masquerades in the first dance
Thistled locks ripping at the roots as he heads her 'home'
In the fug of London the crawdads tear past not stopping to glance. 

Mudlarks throw up dirt and poke their noses below the water line - 
every dry schitt of the shovel through rock and pete 
is dulled by the return of water. Soon the tide will turn
and they will re-assume their positions. 

Smoke chokes, throats filling, mucus moat against the air.
