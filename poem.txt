Tryanny in the streets

Wanton anger cries aloft as woman turned her cheek
The fury flouted all regard to meet her 
Upon seeing him in ugly fullness she felt sweetly weak.
When he comest see not the form he takes but what he becomes
A delicate touch on a dainty wrist as he masquerades in the first dance
Thistled locks ripping at the roots as he heads her 'home'
In the fug of London the nightlarks tear past not stopping to glance.
